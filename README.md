ABCDLV Phonebook Project.

The reason for this repository is to do a proposed project for DSA Class 2024 sem 2.\
To assist a Namibian telecommunications company to create an efficient phonebook,\
based on basic linear data structures, to deliver reasonably efficient performance for typical phonebook operations. 

Group ABCDLV's approach is to incorporate a Linked List to store the phonebook data.\
A Graphical user interface (GUI) is used to provide a user friendly way to interact with  the data.\
Functions used to achieve the required operations are listed below.\
The linkded list should populate and sort at the start of the application. It should then display all the contacts in the main phonebook screen. \
When closing the application all data in the linked list will write to the .txt document overwriting old data to ensure only current data is available. 

Modules\
CreateBookEntry_1  (Leon Riekert),\
LinkedListNode (Leon Riekert),\
LinkedListSorting  (Leon Riekert),\
MainPhonebookUI_1 (Leon Riekert),\
PhoneBookMain  (Leon Riekert),\
ReadWriteFile_1  (Leon Riekert),\
SearchContact  (Chanelle De Waal),\
UpdateScreen_1  (Johannes Mouton),


Operations,\
Insert/create - Add phonebook entry. ,\
Search - Search for user details, based on the linear search algorithm,\
Delete - Using a loop to iterate through the contacts until located then deleted.\
Update - Searches for user to update then write to file after confirmation.

A pseudocode and flowchart are provided to interpret how the code(java) works.
